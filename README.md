# BlockhainTask_Quillhash
A task of Tic tac toe to implement on Solidity

So first is to write file name on Remix as .Sol as extension and try to write code in javascript. 
After getting success with no compilation Error you need to deploy it on the javascript virtual machine provided by the Remix.
U need To Set the Account Id and copy the Hash Code for playing it with two person on same machine. For playing it on two different machine, use differnt account. 

I have pfmv of moving the position using coordinate System. and the Display is show in the squareString.
If the player puts 1,1 the X is in middle position. If its 1,2 then in the left bottom position.
In the mean time by clicking on the button isGameFinish and win we can know the winner. Also these are the functions written in the code.
If there is winner then the hashcode will change to certain value otherwise it will be 000000.
Also for simplicity you can change the user interface of Tic Tac Toe in the html,css on the front-side.
